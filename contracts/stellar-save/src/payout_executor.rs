//! Payout Executor Module
//!
//! This module implements the core fund distribution mechanism for the Stellar-Save
//! ROSCA (Rotational Savings and Credit Association) smart contract.
//!
//! The payout executor orchestrates the automated transfer of pooled funds to eligible
//! recipients when a savings cycle completes. It handles:
//! - Cycle completion verification
//! - Recipient identification based on payout position
//! - Payout amount calculation
//! - Fund transfer execution
//! - Payout record creation
//! - Member status updates
//! - Cycle advancement
//! - Event emission
//!
//! The design follows a permissionless execution model where any address can trigger
//! payout execution once preconditions are met.
